##Setup Repository on Github
####Make Local Repository
<ol>
<li>Make a project folder on local machine and do right click on project folder on local. After right click select "Git Bash Here" open and click on it then it'll open git bash window. We have to write command in GIT bash window for setup our project.</li>
<li>Write a command for generate SSH Key command is<br>
<b>$ ssh-keygen</b>
<br>
then we'll see one code for successfully generated SSH Key<br>
<pre>Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Sourabh/.ssh/id_rsa):
/c/Users/Sourabh/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Sourabh/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Sourabh/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Fy7SPSpHwIZ6iR4JYlw/4HobjGQG3RlR8fUmjQh2Sgc Sourabh@Sourabh-PC
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|.. +o=Eoo .      |
|o + == * o +     |
|o* ..o= o + +    |
|*.++ o.o o +     |
| o=+o . S =      |
| ..oo  o + .     |
|  ..  . o        |
|       o         |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
</pre>
<h6>Now key is generated</h6>
</li>
<li>We have to check and copy key by the command below<br>
<b>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</b><br>
then we'll see one code for display and copy SSH Key<br>
<pre>
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCsilnY2Y8QjcmfU3mZw6aj7fXWJC5IlvaNwhRVQkTB+f9Zp4z3yP69BzM8TMU0xtCTtYzLTqAQ+tLoUe/TmL1SqajK82i8chBDYAEYjPQDkBDRRyMpTjoxS2v7/eJ+gOsqI3rXFcsakGxhNSLCyhHZj4auE467v/u5rJevXfJFUUjuZheSdmi0oqdfx09Y6qCzn2VvJgzH7OGSBUDmIHhmsCLZ+Y4Ylwbmx88Q2yGAJN+bn+ONDlP4SRf8w+UtJzsE8yvXzcfZglEKYy90BUbB2SU5mjgRP+5r9VcCs84GwjilKqbMCkNzISUUTwToxcrbGsy8QRkYZ3GWRm6NkfNn Sourabh@Sourabh-PC
</pre>
<h6>Key generated</h6>
</li>
<li>Now we have to write the command below<br>
<b>$ git clone <u>Repository URl copy from green colored "clone and download button"</u></b><br>
<h6>EX:</h6><br>
<b>$ git clone https://github.com/SourabhMPatrikar/Smanagement.git</b><br>
then we'll see one code to know about clone status<br>
<pre>
Cloning into 'Smanagement'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
</pre>
<h6>Clone Done</h6>
</li>
<li>In next step we have to initiate git by the command below
<br><b>$ git init</b>
<br>then we'll see one code to know about init git (.git)<br>
<pre>
Initialized empty Git repository in D:/ng-Sourabh/s-management/.git/
</pre>
<h6>Init Done</h6>
</li>
<li>For next step we should add and link git repository be following command<br>
<b>$ git remote add origin git repository link</b>
<br><h6>EX:</h6>
<b>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:SourabhMPatrikar/Smanagement.git</b><br>
<h6>Add and link with git done</h6>
</li>
</ol>

#### PUSH, PULL, STATUS, ADD-M, COMMIT
<ol>
<li><b>$ git status</b><br>
<h6>after above command GIT Bash will show file status of file,For that red color for not added file and green color for added files</h6><br>
Now you can see the code like below in red<br>
<pre>

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>
</li>
<li><b>$ git remote -v</b><br>
for check our fetch and push url<br>
Now you can see the code like<br>
<pre>
origin  git@github.com:SourabhMPatrikar/Smanagement.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:SourabhMPatrikar/Smanagement.git (push)
</pre>
</li>
<li><b>$ git add .</b><br>
